# Deep Distillation Protocol (Lexicon)

**Trigger:** When the user asks to distill a meeting note (e.g. "Distill this meeting note").

Goal:
Convert structured evidence into long-term knowledge about people, product, org, and decisions.

Meeting notes = evidence  
Distillation = durable knowledge

Never reinterpret transcript directly unless the user asks.
Distilled knowledge is not dashboard, it is big memory for AI to extract information.
Memory should be append-only.
Do not rewrite past insights unless clearly wrong.
Patterns emerge from history.

## Step 0 — Read Meeting Note

Read sections in order:

1. Signals
2. Decisions
3. Action Items
4. Summary
5. Context

Signals are primary input.

## Step 1 — Determine routing category (deterministic)

Use meeting_type + context (not signal taxonomy) to route most outputs:

A) People-focused routing
- If meeting_type in [1:1, small_group] AND context in [internal]
  → update People pages for relevant participants (excluding obvious “group” entities)

B) Product routing
- If context in [external] OR meeting_type in [customer, interview]
  → update Memory/Product pages for relevant topics

C) Org routing
- If meeting_type in [leadership, team] AND context in [internal]
  → update Memory/Org pages for relevant topics

D) Decisions routing (always)
- If Decisions section contains entries (not “(None)”)
  → update Memory/Decisions

E) Personal routing
- Always update Memory/Personal from AI Evaluation (if meaningful)

If uncertain between Product vs Org:
- Prefer Product when external voices appear (customer/partner)
- Prefer Org when only internal discussion

## Step 2 — Output destinations (default)

Create/update only these files:

People pages:
- People/<Project>/<PersonName>.md (use the meeting note's `project` frontmatter)

Topic memory pages (topic-driven, not taxonomy-driven):
- Memory/<Project>/Product/<topic>.md
- Memory/<Project>/Org/<topic>.md

Decisions:
- Memory/<Project>/Decisions/decisions.md  (single log per project)

Personal:
- Memory/<Project>/Personal/ai_evaluation.md  (single log per project)

Topic naming — match-before-create:
1. **List existing files** under `Memory/<Project>/Product/` and `Memory/<Project>/Org/`.
2. **Check registry:** Look up the proposed topic slug in `Metadata/topic_registry.md`.
   If it matches an alias, use the canonical slug instead.
3. **Fuzzy match:** If the proposed slug is semantically close to an existing slug
   (e.g. `pricing_model` when `pricing` exists), use the existing one.
4. **New topic:** If genuinely new, add it to the topic registry first, then create the file.

Create a topic page whenever a meaningful signal appears.
Early-stage startups often have weak signals that become important later.
Low-confidence signals are allowed but must include evidence.


## Step 3 — Distill from each section (what to extract)

### 3.1 Signals (neutral) → primary source
Signals are primary input for distillation.

Extract signals generously.
Include subtle, weak, or ambiguous signals if they may matter later.

Do NOT filter based on current importance.
Future patterns may emerge.

Always keep evidence and attribution.

### 3.2 Decisions → Decisions memory
Copy decisions with owner + reason if present.
If unclear, record as “Decision (pending)” and keep evidence.

### 3.3 Action Items → (optional)
Only record durable action items (multi-week or strategic).
Daily tactical to-dos should remain only in the meeting note.

### 3.4 AI Evaluation → Personal memory
Always extract AI evaluation bullets.
This is allowed to be subjective.

## Evidence-first principle

When unsure whether something is important, store it in Evidence Log.

Do not discard ambiguous observations.

Memory pages should keep both:
- interpreted insights
- raw evidence bullets

Future AI may reinterpret them.


## Step 4 — People pages (vague working style, evidence-backed)

Update People/<Project>/<Name>.md only when routing category includes People-focused routing. Use the meeting note's `project` frontmatter to determine `<Project>`.

Recommended People page structure (create if missing):
- # Working Style (observations)
- # Preferences / Constraints (explicit)
- # Current Interests / Concerns
- # Relationships
- # Feedback (attributed)
- # Evidence Log (append-only)

Working Style observations may be added from a single signal if clearly evidenced.  Mark confidence explicitly.
Prefer cautious language.

Example:
- May prefer async updates. (confidence: low, source: 2026-02-01)

Evidence Log entry format (append-only):
- YYYY-MM-DD — <short paraphrase> (confidence: low|med|high) — Source: [[<Meeting Note>]]

### Relationships

When a signal reveals interpersonal dynamics, update the Relationships section.

Entry format:
- **[[OtherPerson]]** — <relationship description>. (confidence: low|med|high, source: YYYY-MM-DD)

Relationship types (suggested, not exhaustive): collaborates-with, reports-to / manages,
mentors / mentored-by, tension-with, influenced-by / influences, sponsors / sponsored-by,
partners-with.

Rules:
1. Write an entry on **both** people's pages (with evidence and date).
2. If a relationship already has an entry, append a new dated observation (don't overwrite).
3. Use inline `#topic` when the relationship centers on a specific subject.

When to extract: explicit feedback between people, visible alignment or misalignment,
delegation patterns, mentoring/coaching moments, tension or conflict (neutral language).
When NOT to: casual conversation with no signal, standard status updates.

## Step 5 — Topic memory pages (Product/Org)

### Memory/<Project>/Product/<topic>.md
Structure:
- # What we learned (durable)
- # Evidence (links)

Add any bullets for product use cases, feedback, requests, confusion, adoption blockers, positioning, pricing, even subtle or speculative.
For external feedback, subtle comments could be important, let's keep track on them. Early-stage signals are often weak but critical.

Each bullet:
- short statement
- date
- link to meeting note
- if the fact also relates to another registered topic, append `#topic_slug` inline

### Memory/<Project>/Org/<topic>.md
Structure:
- # Signals (durable)
- # Evidence (links)

Add bullets for durable internal patterns: blockers, alignment issues, hiring/process concerns.
Use neutral language; no blame.

### Inline `#topic` cross-references

When writing any bullet to a Memory or People page, check whether the fact also relates
to another topic in `Metadata/topic_registry.md`. If yes, append `#topic_slug` inline.
Only use canonical slugs (never aliases). This enables Cursor to grep across topics.

Example: a bullet in `partnership.md` about a pricing constraint →
- Partner X won't accept usage-based pricing; needs flat fee. #pricing (2026-02-15, [[Meeting Note]])

## Step 6 — Decisions log

Memory/<Project>/Decisions/decisions.md append format (use the meeting note's `project`):
- YYYY-MM-DD — Decision: <...> (Owner: <...>) — Source: [[<Meeting Note>]]
If pending:
- YYYY-MM-DD — Pending decision: <...> — Source: [[<Meeting Note>]]

## Step 7 — Personal AI evaluation log

Memory/<Project>/Personal/ai_evaluation.md append format (use the meeting note's `project`):
- YYYY-MM-DD — Meeting: <title>
  - Did well: ...
  - Could improve: ...
  - Experiment: ...
  - Source: [[<Meeting Note>]]

## Step 8 — Traceability back to the meeting note

Always update the meeting note section:
# Distilled

List every file you touched, e.g.
- [[People/personal/Alice]]
- [[Memory/personal/Product/pricing]]
- [[Memory/personal/Org/hiring]]
- [[Memory/personal/Decisions/decisions]]
- [[Memory/personal/Personal/ai_evaluation]]

If nothing was updated, write:
- (No durable updates.)

Do not list Product Direction / roadmap unless the user explicitly asked you to update it. Write in **durable, concise** form.
