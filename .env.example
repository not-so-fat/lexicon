# --- Primary user (you, the note-taker) ---
# Required for Self-evaluation and retrospectives: meeting notes include "What I did well / could improve."
# Without this, the system doesn't know who "I" is. Init syncs it to Metadata/User.md.

# --- Fireflies (per account) ---
# Account = which Fireflies login to fetch from (e.g. work, personal, kite).
# Area = Lexicon context for notes/memory (e.g. work, personal, career, general).
# If your account name is not an area (e.g. "kite"), set AREA_kite=work so notes go to Meetings/work/, not Meetings/kite/.

# If account name differs from area, set AREA_<account> (e.g. AREA_kite=work)

# Optional: override where to save transcripts (default: Transcripts/Fireflies/<account>/)

# --- Areas ---
# Areas: work, personal, career, general (Meetings/<Area>/, People/<Area>/, Memory/<Area>/).
# Fireflies: set AREA_<account> so fetch writes area into transcript frontmatter. Manual: set area in transcript frontmatter only (folder is Transcripts/Manual/, not area-based).
