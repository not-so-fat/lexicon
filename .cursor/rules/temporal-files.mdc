# Temporal files: use .tmp/ only (Lexicon)

In this **Lexicon** project, all temporal/one-off content must go **only** under the top-level folder **`.tmp/`**.

- **One-off or experimental scripts** → `.tmp/scripts/`
- **Script output logs** → `.tmp/logs/`
- **Scratch / temporary files** → `.tmp/` (or a subfolder, e.g. `.tmp/scratch/`)

**Do not:**
- Put temporal scripts or logs in **Transcripts**, **Meetings**, **People**, **Memory**, or **Metadata** (these are the user’s knowledge base).
- Put temporal scripts in **`scripts/`** — that directory is for stable, committed commands only.

When you create a one-off script, write a log file, or need a scratch file, use **`.tmp/`** so the vault and script area stay clean. The repo’s `.gitignore` already excludes `.tmp/`.
