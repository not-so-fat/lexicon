# Meeting Note Creation (Lexicon)

**Trigger:** When processing a raw meeting transcript file (Fireflies, HiNotes, other) into a meeting note.
"Summarize" step is to create a clean, structured presentation of the meeting.
Transcript -(Summarize)-> Structured Evidence -(Distill)-> Knowledge

## 1. Principles
Summary must be
- factual
- traceable
- neutral
- complete enough for later distillation

## 2. 
- People

## 1. Signal filter (before summarizing)

When reading the transcript, pay attention to:

- **Internal team dynamics:** Sentiment, feedback given/received, blockers.
- **External feedback:** Direct feedback on product/project from customers, candidates, advisors, partners.
- **Partnership insight:** Partner motivations, constraints, blockers, next steps.

Capture these in **Analysis** and/or **Key Learnings & Decisions**.

## 2. Structure

**File path:** `Meetings/<Area>/YYYY-MM-DD [Title].md`  
Use the transcript's `area` (or frontmatter) to choose `<Area>` (e.g. work, personal, career).

```markdown
---
title: [Title]
date: [YYYY-MM-DD]
participants:
  - [email-or-name-1]
  - [email-or-name-2]
meeting_link: [If available]
fireflies_id: [If Fireflies; omit for HiNotes/other]
source: [Fireflies | HiNotes | Other]
area: [Area]
tags: [work, personal, career, ...]

# Analysis (from Transcript)
Who, context, main points, decisions. For 1:1s, include a short **Sentiment check** in prose.

# Key Learnings & Decisions

### Project
- Decisions, priorities, scope changes, trade-offs.

### Relationship
- Team dynamics, feedback, trust, morale, career notes.

### Technical
- Only when relevant: protocols, integration details, architecture decisions.

# AI Evaluation (for the user)
**Instruction:** Include this section in every meeting note. The AI analyzes the transcript to give the user feedback on their performance. Use the heading "AI Evaluation (for [Name])" if Metadata/User.md exists and specifies "Primary user: [Name]"; otherwise "AI Evaluation (for the user)".
- What the user did well in this conversation.
- What they could improve (communication, pacing, framing).
- One concrete experiment to try in similar meetings.

# Action Items
- Bullets. Use "(None explicit)" if no clear action items.

# Transcript Link
Raw transcript → path under `Transcripts/Fireflies/<account>/` or `Transcripts/Manual/<Area>/`.

# Distilled
(Initially empty or "(Run **distill** after reviewing this summary.)" After distillation, list every destination updated.)
```
