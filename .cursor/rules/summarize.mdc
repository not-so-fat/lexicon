# Meeting Note Creation (Lexicon)

Trigger: When processing a raw transcript file (Fireflies, HiNotes, other) into a meeting note.
Goal: Produce a clean, structured, traceable meeting note that is safe to distill later.
Transcript -(Summarize)-> Structured Evidence -(Distill)-> Knowledge

## Principles
Summary must be
- factual
- traceable
- neutral
- complete enough for later distillation

Philosophy: Prefer recall over compression.

Do not aggressively summarize.
Preserve subtle, weak, or ambiguous statements if they may matter later.
Future distillation and AI reasoning may extract patterns from them.
Especially if speaker is respected professional / external customers, let's try to keep a lot of learning signals.

## Output file template
**File path:** `Meetings/<Project>/YYYY-MM-DD [Title].md`  
Use the transcript's `project` (or frontmatter) to choose `<Project>` (e.g. personal, company, career).
**Template:** Use `.cursor/templates/meeting_note_template.md`


## Step 1 — Identify metadata (light)

Fill only what is clear.

- meeting_type: one of [1:1, small_group, leadership, team, interview, customer, other]
- context: one of [internal, external]
- participants

**Project assignment:**
The transcript's `project` frontmatter is the default. Before accepting it, check
if the meeting content clearly belongs to a different project listed in
`Metadata/project_registry.md`. Reassign if clearly mismatched; when uncertain,
keep the default. Common overrides:
- Personal account meeting about career → `career`
- Personal account meeting with non-work friends → `friendship`
- Company account meeting about personal mentoring → `career`

**Topics** (3–5 max, snake_case nouns):
Check `Metadata/topic_registry.md` for existing canonical slugs before inventing
new ones. If the subject matches an alias, use the canonical slug. If genuinely
new, add it to the registry under the appropriate project section.

**Tags** (property tags only, max 3):
Tags describe *qualities of the interaction*, not subjects. Subjects go in `topics`.
Use only tags listed in `Metadata/tag_registry.md`. Apply a property tag only when
the meeting substantively has that quality — not for passing mentions.
Never invent new tags — only the user may add tags to the registry.

## Step 2 — Write Context

Purpose of meeting in 1–3 bullets:

- Why meeting happened
- Important background
- Any constraint or urgency

No interpretation.

## Step 3 — Record Atmosphere

Brief notes on tone and mood:
- relaxed | tense | rushed | enthusiastic | neutral
- Any notable energy shifts or emotional undercurrents

Keep factual and brief (1–2 lines max).

## Step 4 — Write Summary (factual)

Rules:

- Preserve disagreements
- Preserve uncertainty
- Use concrete language
- Avoid vague sentences (“good discussion”)

Example:

Bad:
- They talked about pricing.

Good:
- Alice said pricing tiers confuse customers.
- Bob said flexibility is more important.

## Step 5 — Extract Decisions

Only if explicitly stated.

Format:
- Decision
  - Owner
  - Why
  - Confidence: low | med | high

If none → "(None)"

## Step 6 — Extract Action Items

Record action items unless clearly trivial.
Even small tasks can reveal priorities, constraints, or relationships later.

Format:
- Owner
  - Task
  - Due

If none → "(None)"

## Step 7 — Record Unresolved Points

Record confusing or unresolved points that came up but weren't resolved.
Future meetings may clarify them.

Format:
- Unresolved point (brief)
  - Why it matters (if clear)
  - Who raised it (if known)

If none → "(None)"

## Step 8 — Extract Signals (CRITICAL)

### Objective of Signal Extraction

Signals capture durable information that should influence future decisions, relationships, or product direction.

Capture signals:
1. It will likely matter in 3+ months
2. It affects people, product, org, learnings
  - people: sentiment, feedback given/received, motivations, blockers, working styles
  - product: feedbacks on vision / product, relevant products / partners / competitors, use cases
  - org: focused goals, constraints, risks
  - learnings: new technical/business knowledge, tips not specific to the project

Priority:
Tier 1 – always capture: decisions, customer feedback, blockers, explicit feedback, major risks
Tier 2 – capture if clear: communication style, motivation, partnership intent, strategy disagreement
Tier 3 – usually skip: status updates, casual comments, small clarifications

Use this minimal format:

- type: <taxonomy_id> (one of: people, product, org, decision, risk, learning)
- target: <person/team/product> (optional)
- topic: <snake_case_topic>
- evidence: "<quote or precise paraphrase>" — <speaker or 'one participant'>

Rules:
- Do NOT infer personality or intent
- If attribution unclear → say "one participant"

## Step 9 — Verification Pass

Before saving:

- Each signal has evidence
- Each signal has topic + context
- No interpretation words ("seems", "likely")
- Decisions are explicit
- Summary understandable without transcript

## Step 10 — AI Evaluation

Always include an AI Evaluation section analyzing the user's performance in the conversation.
The AI writes this based on transcript evidence.

Analyze:
- What the user did well in the conversation
- What they could improve (communication, pacing, framing)
- One concrete experiment to try in similar meetings

## Philosophy

Meeting notes = structured evidence.
Signals = classification-ready observations.
Distill = durable knowledge.

Never mix them.
