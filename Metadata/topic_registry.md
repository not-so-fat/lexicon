# Topic Registry

Canonical topic slugs for Memory pages and frontmatter `topics` field.
Before creating a new Memory topic file, check this registry and existing
files under `Memory/<Project>/`.

**Maintained by:** both user and Cursor. During distill, Cursor may add genuinely new
topics (after confirming no existing slug or alias matches). Users may reorganize,
merge, or rename topics at any time.

## Rules

1. Use **nouns**, not verbs or phrases. `pricing` not `discuss_pricing`.
2. **Singular form** preferred. `partnership` not `partnerships`.
3. **Max 2 words** in slug. `hiring_process` is ok; `engineering_hiring_process_2026` is not.
4. If a topic exists here, always use the canonical slug (never an alias).
5. If a new topic is genuinely needed, add it here before creating the Memory file.

## Inline `#topic` usage

In Memory and People pages, append `#topic_slug` inline when a fact also
relates to another topic. Only use canonical slugs. Do not use inline tags
in meeting notes or transcripts.
